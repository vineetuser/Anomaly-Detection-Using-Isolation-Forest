1. Data Preparation:

2. Model Training: The IsolationForest model is initialized with a specified contamination parameter (indicating the expected proportion of anomalies) and a random state for    reproducibility.
   The model is then fitted on the feature data and predictions are made. The model returns 1 for normal points and -1 for anomalies.

3. Result Interpretation:
   Anomalies are identified by filtering the DataFrame where the prediction is -1.

The Isolation Forest algorithm is a powerful tool for anomaly detection, and its working mechanism is based on a simple yet effective idea: anomalies are "few and different." Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

1. Building Isolation Trees
Random Subsampling:
The algorithm begins by selecting a random subsample of the data (often without replacement). This reduces computational overhead and helps build a diverse set of trees.
Random Splitting:
For each tree (called an isolation tree), the algorithm:
Randomly selects a feature.
Chooses a random split value between the minimum and maximum values of that feature in the subsample.
This process is repeated recursively, partitioning the data until every data point is isolated (i.e., ends up in its own leaf node).


2. Isolation and Path Length
Isolation Process:
Every time a data point is split from the rest of the data, the process moves down a level in the tree. The number of splits (or the depth at which a point becomes isolated) is recorded as the path length.
Key Observation:
Anomalies are few and typically have values that are very different from the bulk of the data. Because of this, they tend to be isolated in fewer splits (resulting in shorter path lengths).
Normal points lie within dense clusters and usually require more splits to be isolated, resulting in longer path lengths.

3. Decision Making
Thresholding:
Once every data point has an anomaly score, a threshold is applied. Data points with scores above this threshold are flagged as anomalies.
Contamination Parameter:
In practice, many implementations (like scikit-learn’s IsolationForest) let you set a contamination parameter that represents the expected proportion of anomalies in the data. This parameter helps in determining the threshold for classifying a point as an anomaly.
